# Copilot Instructions for Luxor-Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This appears to be a new project in initial setup phase. As an AI assistant working in this codebase, you should:

1. Follow established naming conventions and project structure as they are developed
2. Help maintain clean organization of code as the project grows
3. Document new patterns and conventions as they emerge
4. Suggest best practices for project organization while respecting the team's chosen approaches

## Current Project State
- The project is in its initial setup phase
- Only basic repository structure exists with a root README.md

## Development Setup
The project currently has no specific development setup requirements established. As build tools, testing frameworks, and dependencies are added:
- Document setup steps here
- Include common development commands
- Note any environment-specific requirements

## Project Conventions
As conventions and patterns emerge during development:
- Document code organization patterns
- Note naming conventions
- Describe architectural decisions
- List important workflows

## Key Files and Directories
Currently the project contains:
- `/readme.md` - Project documentation (empty)
- `/.github/copilot-instructions.md` - This guidance file

## Contribution Guidelines
When contributing to this project:
1. Follow emerging patterns and conventions
