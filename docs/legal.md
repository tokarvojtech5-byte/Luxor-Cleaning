# Legal & Insurance

Keep a record of permits, registrations, and insurance certificates here.

Recommended:
- General liability insurance
- Workers' compensation (if hiring employees or contractors)
- Local business registration or DBA

Store copies of policy numbers and broker contact info (do not commit scanned sensitive documents to the repository).
