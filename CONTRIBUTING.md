# Contributing to Luxor-Cleaning

Thanks for helping improve Luxor-Cleaning's public repo. This repository is primarily marketing and documentation used to publish a basic website and operational docs.

Rules for contribution
- Keep changes to content (docs, website) clear and atomic.
- Use descriptive commit messages, e.g. "docs: add deep-clean checklist" or "website: update contact info".
- Avoid adding sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal IDs). Remove secrets before committing.

Editing the website
- The public site scaffold lives in `website/`. Edit `index.html` and `styles.css` for content and styling.
- If you add JavaScript, keep it minimal and self-contained in `website/`.

Documentation
- Operational docs are under `docs/`.
- Add a short front-matter line at the top of new files describing purpose and last-updated date.

Publishing
- After editing, commit locally and push to `origin main`. The repo owner will enable GitHub Pages if desired.

Thank you â€” small, clear PRs are easiest to review.
